## Infrastructure Setup with EFS, ECS and ALB  

### Objective  
Create a simple **AWS** infrastructure using **IaC (CloudFormation or Terraform)** to deploy a basic web application. Utilize Amazon EFS to store the **HTML** page content and Amazon **ECS** for containerized deployment.  

---

## Requirements  

### Amazon EFS  
- Create an **Amazon EFS file system** named `tm-devops-test-efs.`  
- Ensure that the **EFS file system** is mounted on the **ECS instances** to store the **HTML** content.  
- Use appropriate security settings for the **EFS**.  

### Amazon ECS  
- Define an **ECS** task definition that runs a **Docker container**.  
- Use a public Docker image of the **Nginx** web server.  
- Mount the **EFS file system** to the container to serve the **HTML** content.  
- Configure the **ECS service** to run 1 task.  

### ALB  
- Create an ALB named `tm-devops-test-alb.`  
- Configure the ALB listener on port `80` to forward traffic to the **ECS service**.  
- Implement health checks on the **ALB** to ensure the **ECS** service's availability.  

### Security Group  
- Create security groups for both the **ECS** instances and the **ALB**.  
- Allow incoming traffic on port 80 to the **ECS** instances from the **ALB**.  
- Configure appropriate security settings for the **ALB**.  

### Web Application  
- Create a simple **HTML page** with the content: **"Devops rules the world!"**  
- Upload this **HTML page** to the **EFS** file system.
